Create a story outline in the format "The 3-Act Story Structure" with the structure like

Act 1:
Chapter 1 - Action:
Start with something happening to draw the reader into the story.
Chapter 2 - Background:
Provide context for readers to understand how the characters came to the current situation
Chapter 3 - Conflict:
The characters must want something they don’t have and work to achieve it (sometimes against each other)
Chapter 4 - Development 1:
Describing the characters’ struggles to get what they want.
Chapter 5 - Development 2:
Each time it appears they have the goal within reach, give them something more difficult to overcome until they reach the climax.
Chapter 6 - End:
What happens after they reach their goal. In a romance, the hero and heroine realize their “happily-ever-after”. In a mystery or thriller, all the loose ends are tied up. In a literary story, the ending may be rather ambiguous.

Output should be in JSON format as follows:
{
"acts": [
{
"name": "The name of the act",
"chapters": [
{
"name": "The name of the chapter",
"short_description": "A detailed description of what happens in this chapter. It should contain a beginning middle part and an end that leads to the next chapter.",
"events": "Notable events in the chapter.",
"people": "Description of people in the chapter.",
"places": "Description of the places in this chapter.",
"from_previous_chapter": "Summary of what we got from the previous chapter. N/A for first chapter.",
"to_next_chapter": "Summary of what we will send to the next chapter. N/A for last chapter."
}
]
}
]
}

Don't include any text in front or after the JSON object.

Use Double Quotes for Keys and String Values.
Avoid Double Quotes Inside String Values. Instead, use Single Quotes.
All opening double quotes should have a corresponding closing double quote.
